## Python Data Structure

We are going to cover the whole basic to advance data structure using python.
The course is created purposingly for Interview practice and development.

1. Introduction
Programming Development
    - Data Structures
        - Data Structures methods (Array, LinkedList, Tress)
    - Algorithms
        - Procedure that contains steps for peforming a task.
    - Efficiency depends on 
        - Running times
        - Memory 
    - Measuring running
        - Experimental Method
        - Analytical Method
    - Asymptotic analysis
        - we see and notice what happens when input size is double.   
    - Big O Notation
        - behaviour of a function -> how fast a function f(n) grows as n becomes large.
        - f(n) is O(g(n)) if there const c and n0 such that
        - f( n) <= c g(n) for all n >= n0
    - Find Big O
        - f(n) = 3n2 + 4n + 15
        - Big O analysis -> value of the function as n becomes larges
        - When n becomes large -> Fastest growing term becomes dominant 
        - Lower terms and constants become isignificant
